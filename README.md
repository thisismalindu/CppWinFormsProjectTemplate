# A Simple Windows Forms Application Project Template in C++/CLR.

-  _Note: If  images in this article are blurry, right click on them and open in new tab._

Use this template to create a **Windows Forms Application** using **C++**. This is similar to the Windows Forms Application Project Template for C#, provided in VS by default.

VS2010 included something like this, but from 2021 it has been removed. So use this template to create GUI apps using C++/CLR with the WinForms Framework provided with .NET.

To install the extension, just **download and run the installer.**

To create a new project, **Launch Vs, Create New Project->Search for _CppWinForms_**

If you are **getting this error**
